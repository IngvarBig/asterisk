# 📞 Asterisk Dialplan: Smart Outbound Routing Example

This repository contains a universal example of a custom Asterisk dialplan that implements dynamic outbound call routing based on:

- **Extension range authorization**
- **Number normalization**
- **Mobile number detection**
- **Call counter logic**
- **Routing between GSM and TDM trunks**
- **Call recording**
- **Invalid number handling and logging**

## 🛠 Features

### ✅ Extension Range Check
Only allows outbound calls from internal extensions within a specific range.  
Customize it by changing the values of `EXT_START` and `EXT_END`.

### 🔢 Number Normalization
Cleans up outbound numbers, including:
- Removing `+` signs
- Adjusting to a local/national format (customize as needed)

### 📱 Mobile Number Detection
Flags numbers as mobile if they start with configurable prefixes, e.g., `79`, `89`, etc.

### 🔄 Call Counter Logic
Keeps track of how many mobile calls have been made. Every Nth call (e.g., every 25th) is routed through an alternate trunk (e.g., TDM), while others go through the default (e.g., GSM).

### 🔀 Trunk Routing
Dynamically decides which trunk to use (`TDM_TRUNK` or `GSM_TRUNK`) based on logic.

### 🎧 Call Recording
Each call is recorded with a unique filename structure:  
`out-DST-CALLERID-TIMESTAMP.wav`

### 🚫 Invalid Call Handling
If a call does not meet routing criteria (e.g., invalid format for TDM), it's logged and dropped.

## 🧩 Structure Overview

```asterisk
[from-internal-custom]
  → Checks if caller is authorized to route

[custom-routing]
  → Normalizes number
  → Detects mobile numbers
  → Increments call counter
  → Chooses route based on counter
  → Jumps to [tdm], [gsm] or [invalid]

[tdm]
  → Validates and routes through TDM trunk
  → Records the call

[gsm]
  → Routes through GSM trunk
  → Records the call

[invalid]
  → Logs the attempt and ends the call
